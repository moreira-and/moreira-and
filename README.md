# üëã Hello! I am Andr√©! üìä

I am a data professional from Brazil!

I didn't start my career in data. I began by selling chocolate with my family before I transitioned to working in industries with machines. I studied these machines in a professional course at Unicamp, called COTUCA. This experience inspired me to embark on a journey to discover how these systems work. 

I completed a bachelor's degree in Control and Automation Engineering at UNICAMP, which exposed me to a vast context: how nature relates to machines. The answer lies in the variables from sensors. These sensors provide data on electrical variations, and with the context input into equations, we can model patterns found in nature. We use these models to create systems that perform tasks for us.

These systems can be physical or probabilistic. Machine learning embodies this concept, and I love it. We model natural contexts into functions to learn for ourselves and make informed decisions.

This idea drives me to take on another challenge: to define patterns from reality in different contexts. This is the power of data.

I would love to discuss how I can create value with data for you. Let's connect!
