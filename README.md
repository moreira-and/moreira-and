# üëã Hello! I am Andr√©! üìä

I help companies increase their performance and achieve strategic goals by aligning teams and leveraging data to uncover opportunities, identify patterns, and support decision-making. I transform information into valuable insights, presented through interactive dashboards or implemented into software rules, including machine learning techniques, enabling more assertive and agile decision-making.

My work includes creating automated reports, conducting exploratory analyses to identify opportunities, and developing models that automate business decisions. Additionally, my background in process mapping, training, Lean Six Sigma projects, and operational excellence philosophies allows me to combine data analytics with the ability to understand and optimize processes, delivering results that positively impact both strategy and operations.

If you‚Äôre looking to turn data into actionable insights, optimize processes, or explore new improvement opportunities, let‚Äôs connect!
