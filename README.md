# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am AndrÃ©! ðŸ“Š

I design and evolve modern data ecosystems, integrating the full analytical cycle (descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive) to transform information into high-impact strategic decisions. I deliver everything from executive visualizations that synthesize historical patterns and trends to Machine Learning and AI models that anticipate scenarios and simulate strategic actions. I act as a bridge between technical teams and business areas, translating complexity into clarity and guiding initiatives based on evidence. I adopt proven practices in governance, security, observability, and version control, ensuring that data and models are reliable, scalable, and aligned with future demands, accelerating the organizationâ€™s analytical maturity and competitive advantage.
