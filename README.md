# 👋 Hello! I am André! 📊

Through my academic and professional experiences, I developed expertise in analyzing processes, designing automated workflows, and creating data-driven solutions to improve efficiency and decision-making. My work focuses on leveraging **Power Platform tools** (Power BI, Power Apps, Power Automate) to build dashboards, applications, and automated workflows that empower teams with actionable insights.

Now, I am deepening my knowledge in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning** to explore new ways of transforming raw data into meaningful patterns, building predictive models, and making informed decisions. My aim is to harness the power of data and algorithms to solve real-world challenges.
